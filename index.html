                    <p>There are some detrimental gaps in your current group insurance plans that are in force through the government or private employers. Our goal is to provide you with the opportunity to fill in those missing gaps. So that you and your family will be properly protected and taken care of in case you face an occupational hazard. It is important to note that this plan is not intended to replace your current coverage, rather to enhance it.</p>
